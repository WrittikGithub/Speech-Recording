# Audio Editor Implementation

## Overview

The audio editor has been implemented with a functional interface that provides five core audio effects with simulated processing. While the current implementation simulates audio processing for demonstration purposes, the architecture is designed to easily accommodate real audio processing libraries in the future.

## Implemented Audio Effects

### 1. Echo Effect
- **Function**: Adds a delayed repetition of the original sound, creating a reverberation effect
- **Parameters**:
  - Delay: 0.1 - 2.0 seconds
  - Decay: 0.1 - 1.0 (strength of echo)
- **UI**: Shows current echo values in dialog

### 2. Amplify Effect
- **Function**: Increases or decreases the volume/gain of the audio
- **Parameters**:
  - Gain: 0.1 - 3.0x (10% to 300% volume)
- **UI**: Shows current gain level based on audio analysis

### 3. Noise Reduction Effect
- **Function**: Reduces background noise and unwanted artifacts
- **Parameters**:
  - Strength: 0.1 - 1.0 (10% to 100% reduction)
- **UI**: Shows current noise level and reduction strength

### 4. Pitch Adjustment Effect
- **Function**: Changes the pitch of the audio without affecting duration
- **Parameters**:
  - Pitch: 0.5 - 2.0x (half pitch to double pitch)
- **UI**: Shows current pitch multiplier

### 5. Silence Remover Effect
- **Function**: Automatically removes or reduces silent portions
- **Parameters**:
  - Threshold: 0.01 - 0.5 (1% to 50% silence level)
- **UI**: Shows current silence threshold

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Processing Pipeline

- **Loading States**: Operation-specific progress indication

## Usage Flow

1. **Initialize**: Audio file is analyzed to determine properties
2. **Apply Effects**: Users can apply multiple effects with real-time feedback
3. **Preview**: Creates a processed file copy for preview playback
4. **Save**: Generates final processed audio file with all effects

## Effect Parameters and Defaults

### Echo
